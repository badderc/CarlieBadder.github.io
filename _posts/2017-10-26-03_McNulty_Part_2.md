## **...find a problem with it**

I thought more about what I wanted to accomplish with
the activity classifier and I realized that a Random Forest
Classifier would be too computationally intensive to use on 
a wearable-sized device. Also, the models I was using are not
necessarily meant for time series data. Technically the model
worked, but it considered the data as a random collection of 
labeled x-, y-, and z-accelerations and angular velocities
rather than a series of time-dependent measurements.
 
So, I decided to look at the data as a time series and consider
other metrics that would be more practical for a live stream of
accelerations and angular velocities. 
 
## Time and Cadence: Sounds like a frequency problem

My first idea was to look into the frequency domain and take
a fast fourier transform of the magnitude of acceleration to
see what happened. It turns out that the fft does a pretty
great job of distinguishing running from walking.

The average maximum frequency response of running occurs 
at a greater frequency and amplitude than the maximum of 
the walking acceleration magnitude.

When I used the difference between the two mean maximum
frequency responses as the threshold to distinguish walking 
from running across the entire dataset, the results exactly
matched the original walking vs running labels:

## Wearable Tech: Low Processing Power
 
Unfortunately, FFT is too computationally intensive to calculte
live-time on the small electronics typically found in 
activity trackers. So I had to funnel down deeper and consider
simpler metrics, such as the mean, maximum, minimum, standard 
deviation, median, and median absolute deviation. Any of these
methods would be very easy to process in a wearable device in
live-time. Luckily, many of these metrics also did a decent job
distinguishing walking from running. 
 
## Generally speaking though...

None of the specific results and thresholds produced from the 
above metrics will be useful for any runner other than the 
one subject in this dataset. Unfortunately, no one else will 
have the exact same cadence, body build, arm swing, etc 
which means any model I've created won't generalize to the 
population. If I were to continue this project, I would get 
data from a variety of subjects and see if I could develop a 
better, more generalizable model. 
 
## I also had some fun with data visualization
I tried my hand at Plotly, D3, and Flask

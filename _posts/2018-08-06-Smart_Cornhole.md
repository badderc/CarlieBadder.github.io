## What is Cornhole?
Cornhole, also known as _baggo_, is a now popular lawn game that originated in Massachusetts
in the late 1800s. It was slightly different in the very beginning; there were different
sized bags and holes, but the concept was mostly the same. Picture horseshoe, but with 
bean bags and a board with a hole instead of a post, and you can get points for landing a 
bag on the board or getting a bag through the hole. Players take turns tossing bean bags, 
typically in teams of 1-2 with 4 bags per team. Rules can vary, but usually the goal is to
get to 21 points first. Either way, it's a great game, there's even a play called a 
_cornucopia_ (when all bags make it into the hole in one frame) - how fun! And it's a great
excuse to get outside, play, bond, drink, compete, etc.
### On top of all that, cornhole is an excellent candidate for an IoT solution
...and to implement a Raspberry Pi, some data-warehousing practice, and data science!

## Why Cornhole?
There is an issue plaguing cornhole players across the nation.
